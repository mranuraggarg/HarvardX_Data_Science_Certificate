## Question 4

You have a data frame of monthly sales and profits in R: 

```
> head(dat)
# A tibble: 5 x 3
Month     Sales     Profit 
<chr>     <chr>     <chr>  
January   $128,568  $16,234
February  $109,523  $12,876
March     $115,468  $17,920
April     $122,274  $15,825
May       $117,921  $15,437
    
```

Data is stored in `question4_31.csv`

```{r}
dat <- read_csv('question4_31.csv', col_names = TRUE)
head(dat)
```

Which of the following commands could convert the sales and profits columns to numeric? Select all that apply.

```{r}
dat %>% mutate_at(2:3, parse_number)
```

```{r}
dat %>% mutate_at(2:3, funs(str_replace_all(., c("\\$|,"), ""))) %>% 
    mutate_at(2:3, as.numeric)
```
