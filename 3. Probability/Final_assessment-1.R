# An insurance company offers a one-year term life insurance policy 
# that pays $150,000 in the event of death within one year. 
# The premium (annual cost) for this policy for a 50 year 
# old female is $1,150. Suppose that in the event of a claim, 
# the company forfeits the premium and loses a total of $150,000, 
# and if there is no claim the company gains the premium amount of $1,150. 
# The company plans to sell 1,000 policies to this demographic.

# Question 1a
# The death_prob data frame from the dslabs package contains information 
# about the estimated probability of death within 1 year (prob) for 
# different ages and sexes.

# remains alive is the premium $1,150.

# one policy for a 50 year old female?

# Question 2b
# Suppose the company wants its expected profits from 
# 1,000 50 year old males with $150,000 life insurance 
# policies to be $700,000. Use the formula for expected

# Question 2d
# What is the probability of losing money on a series of

pnorm(0, mu_s, se_s)

# Life insurance rates are calculated using mortality statistics 
# from the recent past. They are priced such that companies are 
# almost assured to profit as long as the probability of death 
# remains similar. If an event occurs that changes the probability 
# of death in a given age group, the company risks significant losses.
# In this 6-part question, we'll look at a scenario in which a lethal 
# pandemic disease increases the probability of death within 1 year 
# for a 50 year old to .015. Unable to predict the outbreak, the
